#A warning and visitation to the inhabitants of Godalming All you that read this, be not rash, but weigh it right with the true weight, and the even ballance, the ballance of the sanctuary, and then you will not judge amiss of it; for it is not in hatred or reproach to any, but in love to all souls, in plainness and truth. And you inhabitants of Godalming, be warned, and seriously consider of this visitation; for the spirit of the Lord yet strives with you as with the old world, but they not taking warning, were drowned: therefore prise your time, and despise not the reproof of instruction, for such are brutish; but reprove or instruct a wise man, and he will love thee; reprove a scorner, and he will hate thee; but the reproof of instruction is the way of life to the wise; and a wise man will hear and increase in wisdom: be calm therefore, and learn of the light which is the way and the truth. T.P.#
